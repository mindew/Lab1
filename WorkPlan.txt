Work Plan

Understand what ALU is 1.5 hr: 10/1/18
	Create truth table for each operation
	ADD, SUB, XOR, SLT, AND, NAND, NOR, OR
	Decide how we’ll construct ALU 
	Tradeoffs?Delay / Performance
	Have drawn circuit for ALU 
Write Test Bench: 1 hr: 10/1/18
	Make circuit in Verilog 1.5 hr: 10/3/18
Write README 1 hr: 10/5/18
Write Report 2 hr: 10/5/18
	Implementation
	Explain our verilog implementation
	Test Results
	Test Bench Truth Table with expected
	Timing Analysis
	Calculated propagation delay
	Simulated propagation delay
	Work Plan Reflection
		Did we finish tasks on time as we predicted?
		How can we improve better at planning next time?
